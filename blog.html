    <p1>
        When I was writing assignment 2,The biggest problem I encountered was that I had no 
        way to open my own code, and I had no way to establish a connection with the browser. 
        Every time I try to run the program, the browser always shows that the connection request 
        was refused. Later, I re-downloaded the Google Chrome plug-in and selected chrome on the 
        launch website, and then my code ran normally.

        I'm still learning how to fully use all the features in github, I may need more practice.
